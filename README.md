# Music-Downloader
This is a simple Python program that opens a GUI. In the GUI, you can do two things. You can put the name of the artist and the song and watch as it gets downloaded to the downloaded music folder. You can also make a text file for batch downloading and get multiple at once. 

This program was made for people like me who want to download music from YouTube, but do not want to do all the manual work. This program does all of that for you.
